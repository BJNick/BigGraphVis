# Force Atlas 2 - Pole Magnetic Layout

Project at the University of Saskatchewan, 
Visualization Geometry Algorithms (VGA) lab.

## Description

This project is a force-directed layout algorithm for the visualization of
directed graphs. The algorithm is based on the force-directed layout algorithm
and uses a magnetic force to align nodes with a magnetic field, as well as define
magnetic poles which can segment the graph into subgraphs and attract nodes to them.

See also the [Cytoscape App in Java](https://github.com/BJNick/CytoscapeMagneticLayout), which 
is the latest implementation of the pole magnetic layout algorithm, with
many improvements and integrated into Cytoscape.

### To use the C++ version:

Please also download the `usr.zip` which is a library for saving pngs, as well
as `net.zip` which contains data for various graphs for testing.
